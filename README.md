## My process
  I used react.js for this challenge. I revised somethings which i learned in past few days. I used usestates for the functaionality and a lot of css. it's still not completed yet but I am working on it. 
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

What i learned is javascript. I started building my logic and it's awesome.
